## Problem statement: Credit Card Attrition

- Attrition on credit cards has become a major worry for the banking industry.
Given that the expense of obtaining new consumers is higher than the expense of keeping existing customers, it significantly affects profitability.
- In this work, a selection of supervised Machine Learning models to identify which customers want to cancel their credit cards is evaluated.
- Attrition prediction models are important to reduce the cancellation of credit card products and analyze which customers have a greater tendency to cancel. 
- This work was carried out through a strategic segmentation focusing on the client to generate campaigns according to the profile of each one, to understand and anticipate their behavior. Likewise, productive resources were focused on high-value groups, as it is cheaper to retain a client than attract a new one.
